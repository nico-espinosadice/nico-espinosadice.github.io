I am an undergraduate studying mathematics and computer science at [Harvey Mudd College](https://www.hmc.edu/), where I am a [Harvey S. Mudd Merit Scholar](https://www.hmc.edu/admission/afford/scholarships-and-grants/merit-based-scholarships/harvey-s-mudd-merit-award). I am advised by [Professor George D. Montañez](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~montanez/) and [Professor Dagan Karp](https://www.math.hmc.edu/~dk/). I am a member of the [AMISTAD Lab](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~montanez/amistad.html), led by Professor Montañez, where I conduct research in theoretical machine learning. I have also worked with [Profesesor Weiqing Gu](https://math.hmc.edu/gu/) in geometric deep learning. I will be graduating from Harvey Mudd College with a B.S. in May 2022. I will be enrolling in a Ph.D. programa in computer science next fall.

<!-- In terms of coursework, I have enjoyed both applied mathematics and computer science courses – including [mathematics of big data](https://math189bigdata.github.io/index.html) and data structures and program development – and theoretical courses such as abstract algebra, and my major GPA is 3.9. This fall, I will be taking courses in artificial intelligence, algorithms, mathematical analysis, and number theory and cryptography. A full list of the coursework that I have taken is available [here](/img/EspinosaDice_Coursework.pdf). -->

<!-- Our team that developed a probabilistic model of abductive logical reasoning, using a Bayesian network framework, that constructs novel explanations of observed effects for use in machine learning applications. Earlier this month, we submitted the paper to the International Conference on Agents and Artificial Intelligence (ICAART), and we will be submitting a second paper to the Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (PAKDD) this November.
