Hello! I am currently a junior studying mathematics and computer science at [Harvey Mudd College](https://www.hmc.edu/), where I am a [Harvey S. Mudd Merit Scholar](https://www.hmc.edu/admission/afford/scholarships-and-grants/merit-based-scholarships/harvey-s-mudd-merit-award). 

<!-- My interests center around theoretical machine learning, as well as applications of machine learning towards fields including robotics and autonomous vehicles, astronomy and space exploration, medical imaging, and finance and trading.  --> 


This coming summer (2021), I will be working at [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/) as a software engineer intern. Last summer (2020), I worked as a machine learning researcher and team lead in the [AMISTAD Lab](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~montanez/amistad.html) under [Professor George D. Montañez](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~montanez/), a lab at Harvey Mudd College focused on theoretical machine learning research. A more detailed explanation of our research is available on the [About](/about#amistad) page. In the summer of 2019, I worked as a software engineer intern at [Viasat](https://www.viasat.com/). More information about the project I completed while at Viasat is also available on the [About](/about#amistad) page.

<!-- In terms of coursework, I have enjoyed both applied mathematics and computer science courses – including [mathematics of big data](https://math189bigdata.github.io/index.html) and data structures and program development – and theoretical courses such as abstract algebra, and my major GPA is 3.9. This fall, I will be taking courses in artificial intelligence, algorithms, mathematical analysis, and number theory and cryptography. A full list of the coursework that I have taken is available [here](/img/EspinosaDice_Coursework.pdf). -->

<!-- Our team that developed a probabilistic model of abductive logical reasoning, using a Bayesian network framework, that constructs novel explanations of observed effects for use in machine learning applications. Earlier this month, we submitted the paper to the International Conference on Agents and Artificial Intelligence (ICAART), and we will be submitting a second paper to the Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (PAKDD) this November.
