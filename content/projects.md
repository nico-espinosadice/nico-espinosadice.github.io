Descriptions and links for past and present projects.

### [Automated Trading System](https://github.com/nico-espinosadice/quant-trading-system/tree/nico-branch)
**Researcher and Developer**  
*2019 - Present*  
Built a recurrent neural network with long short-term memory architecture using TensorFlow to predict changes in stock price based upon market history. Automated trading of stock using Alpaca API, Bash scripting, and the neural network’s predictions to create a net-positive automated trading system.

### [MARS-I (Mudders Aspiring to Reach Space)](https://sites.google.com/g.hmc.edu/mars)
**IMU Subsystem**  
*2018 - Present*  
The goal of the MARS-I project is to design and build a rocket that will reach the Karman Line: 100 kilometers above the Earth, the edge of space. The project is entirely student-led.

I work on the Electronics and Telemetry Team. Our team is responsible for designing and building a robust parachute deployment, telemetry, and data logging system for the rocket. We aim to incorporate 6DOF tracking for the rocket, environmental sensors, a camera, and real-time telemetry over several radio links.

Within the Electronics and Telemetry Team, I am on the IMU Design Subsystem Team. Our team is responsible for designing and implementing an IMU array to determine the position of the booster and the dart throughout its flight. We are currently implementing a Kalman filter that will allow us to filter the noise generated from the IMU sensors.

### [Regression Analysis of Housing Prices](https://github.com/nico-espinosadice/house-price-prediction)
**Researcher and Developer**  
*2017*  
[Housing_Prices_Analysis.pdf](/img/Housing_Prices_Analysis.pdf)  
Built random forest regression model in Python to predict the final sale prices of Iowa houses with over 90% accuracy. Presented the model’s results to twenty-five General Assembly faculty and students.
