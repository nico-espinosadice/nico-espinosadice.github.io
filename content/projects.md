<!-- ### Identifying Seizures in Electroencephalography Data Through GraphSAGE
**Researcher**  
*September 2021 – Present*  
For my project in [Math189AC: Geometry of Big Data](https://weiqinggu.github.io/Math-189AC-Course-Webpage/), I am developing a [GraphSAGE](http://snap.stanford.edu/graphsage/) model that identifies seizures in the electrical activity data produced from electroencephalography. -->

### [Biometric Authentication of Smartphone Users](https://github.com/nico-espinosadice/biometric-authentication-svms)
*January 2020 - May 2020*  
[Biometric_Authentication_Smartphone_Users.pdf](/img/Biometric_Authentication_Smartphone_Users.pdf)  
For my final project in [Math189R: Mathematics of Big Data](https://math189bigdata.github.io/index.html), I implemented a support vector machine (SVM) model for biometric authentication of smartphone users. 
<!-- Furthermore, I empirically examined the performance of varying kernel functions, including linear, polynomial, sigmoid, and radial basis functions. -->

### [Sentiment Analysis of Covid-19 Related Tweets](https://github.com/nico-espinosadice/covid-tweets-analysis)
*March 2020 - May 2020*  
[Sentiment_Analysis_Tweets.pdf](/img/Sentiment_Analysis_Tweets.pdf)  
For my final project in [Math189Z: Covid-19 Data Analytics and Machine Learning](https://math189covid19.github.io/), I conducted sentiment analysis on Tweets regarding the Covid-19 pandemic using a naive Bayes classifier. Through this project, I examined the relationship between the severity of the virus and its impact on the public's reaction to it, particularly on social media. 
<!-- In doing so, I hoped to develop an understanding of how the public's response – particularly the hysteria many felt as the pandemic approached their area – is correlated to the actual virus's spread. -->

### [Automated Trading System](https://github.com/nico-espinosadice/quant-trading-system/tree/nico-branch)
*January 2019 - May 2019*  
This is an independent project I began to explore time series data. I decided to analyze stock market data, a type of time series data that is readily accessible. I built a recurrent neural network with long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture to predict changes in a company’s stock price based upon market history. I wrote code in Python and used the Tensorflow library to build the neural network. I then used the predictions of the neural network to trade stock through [Alpaca](https://alpaca.markets/), a stock brokerage, and its API. I automated the trading of the stock using Bash scripting.

<!-- ### [MARS-I (Mudders Aspiring to Reach Space)](https://sites.google.com/g.hmc.edu/mars)
**IMU Subsystem**  
*October 2018 - Present*  
The goal of the MARS-I project is to design and build a rocket that will reach the Karman Line: 100 kilometers above the Earth, the edge of space. The project is entirely student-led.

I work on the electronics and telemetry team. Our team is responsible for designing and building a robust parachute deployment, telemetry, and data logging system for the rocket. We aim to incorporate 6DOF tracking for the rocket, environmental sensors, a camera, and real-time telemetry over several radio links.

Within the electronics and telemetry team, I lead the IMU design subsystem. Our team is responsible for designing and implementing an IMU array to determine the position of the booster and the dart throughout its flight. [An IMU (inertial measurement unit) is a sensor that calculates the position and orientation of an object in space]. We are currently implementing a Kalman filter that will allow us to filter the noise generated from the IMU sensors. -->

### [Regression Analysis of Housing Prices](https://github.com/nico-espinosadice/house-price-prediction)
*June 2017 - August 2017*  
[Housing_Prices_Analysis.pdf](/img/Housing_Prices_Analysis.pdf)  
In the summer of 2017, I took [General Assembly's Data Science course](https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science/new-york-city), taught in New York City. During the course, we learned how to build machine learning algorithms – including decision trees, random forest regression and classification models, K-nearest neighbors, and logistic regression. We used Pandas and NumPy for collecting and cleaning the data, and we used Scikit-Learn for implementing the models. As part of the final project for the course, I built a random forest regression model in Python to predict the final sale prices of Iowa houses with 90% accuracy. I then presented the model’s results to General Assembly faculty and students.
