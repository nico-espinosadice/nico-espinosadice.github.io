## [HMC Clinic Program: Rockerbox](https://www.clinic.cs.hmc.edu/)
**Project Manager**  
*September 2021 - Present*  
As part of [HMC's Clinic Program](https://www.clinic.cs.hmc.edu/) this academic year, I have served as the project manager of the undergraduate team working with [Rockerbox](https://www.rockerbox.com/), a marketing attrition company. Our team is building an unsupervised anomaly detection model on time-series marketing data through a dynamic regression model and a long short-term memory (LSTM) autoencoder.


## [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/)
**Software Engineer Intern**  
*May 2021 – August 2021*  
I interned at Etsy on their search query understanding (SQU) team. At the time, the SQU team faced the issue of inappropriate queries being suggested to users and trending as top queries. I developed and implemented the solution to this problem, including constructing the training dataset with SQL. Using Tensorflow, I developed a DistilBERT language model. In addition to supplying the text of the query, I incorporated numerical query metrics into the model’s inputs. Using the Google Cloud Platform for training and storage, the model achieved 91% accuracy, and the SQU team will be moving the model to production.


## [Viasat](https://www.viasat.com/) {#viasat}
**Software Engineer Intern**  
*May 2019 - August 2019*  
I interned at [Viasat](https://www.viasat.com/) on the NextGen Tactical Data Links team. Our intern team of three designed and built a heads-up display that connected to a Link 16 radio network in order to receive, display, and send information. I built REST API using CherryPy Python Library to enable communication between the display and the Link 16 radio network. I implemented a global runtime manager in C# to handle distribution of data into assets, allowing for live updating of heads-up display. The project was [presented](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/viasat-government_ausa2019-nationalasset-activity-6591002603256115200-3vmt) by Viasat at the [Association of the United States Army (AUSA 2019)](https://www.ausa.org/meet) conference. 


<!-- I enabled communication between the display and the Link 16 radio network. To achieve two-way communication, I exposed URL routes on a web server that was connected to the Link 16 network, allowing the encrypted Link 16 messages to be acquired through an HTTP GET request. I built a REST API using the [CherryPy](https://cherrypy.org/) Python library; the REST API issued the web requests to the web server. 


Additionally, I developed the global runtime manager in C# to handle the distribution of the Link 16 messages that were acquired by the REST API. The information was parsed and then distributed into the display’s “assets,” which included a map, compass and radar. Using the Link 16 radio data, I created an interactive and dynamic map, allowing soldiers to view friendly and hostile units in their area. -->

<!-- ## [General Assembly: Data Science Course](https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science/new-york-city)
**Student**  
*June 2017 - August 2017*  
In the summer of 2017, I took [General Assembly's](https://generalassemb.ly/) [data science course](https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science/new-york-city), taught in New York City. During the course, we learned how to build machine learning algorithms – including decision trees, random forest regression and classification models, K-nearest neighbors, and logistic regression. We used Python's [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) libraries for collecting and cleaning the data, and we used the [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) library for implementing the models.

As part of the final project for the course, I built a random forest regression model in Python to predict the final sale prices of Iowa houses with over 90% accuracy. I then presented the model’s results to General Assembly faculty and students. The project is available on [Github](https://github.com/nico-espinosadice/house-price-prediction) and [Housing_Prices_Analysis.pdf](/img/Housing_Prices_Analysis.pdf). -->

<!-- In terms of coursework, I have enjoyed both applied mathematics and computer science courses – including [mathematics of big data](https://math189bigdata.github.io/index.html), data structures and program development, and algorithms – and theoretical courses such as abstract algebra and real analysis. A full list of the coursework that I have taken is available [here](/img/EspinosaDice_Coursework.pdf).
