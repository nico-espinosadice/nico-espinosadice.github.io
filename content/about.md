Hello! I am a rising junior studying mathematics and computer science at Harvey Mudd College. My interests center around theoretical machine learning, as well as applications of machine learning towards fields including robotics and autonomous vehicles, astronomy and space exploration, medical imaging, and finance and trading.

Check out the [Miscellaneous](/miscellaneous) page for other information.

# Experience
## [AMISTAD Lab](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~montanez/amistad.html)
**Machine Learning Researcher**  
*May 2020 - Present*  
This summer, I will be a researcher in the [AMISTAD Lab](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~montanez/amistad.html) under [Professor George D. Montañez](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~montanez/). Our team is currently working on developing a mathematical framework of abductive reasoning for use in machine learning applications.

## [Viasat](https://www.viasat.com/)
**Software Engineer Intern**  
*May 2019 - August 2019*  
Last summer, I interned at [Viasat](https://www.viasat.com/) as a software engineer on the [NextGen TDL](https://www.viasat.com/products/next-gen-link16) team. Our intern team of three designed and built a heads-up display that improved the situational awareness of soldiers by connecting to a [Link 16](https://www.viasat.com/products/link-16-tactical-data-links) radio network – a tactical data link network – in order to receive, display, and send information. The project was [presented](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/viasat-government_ausa2019-nationalasset-activity-6591002603256115200-3vmt) by Viasat at the [2019 Association of the United States Army](https://ausameetings.org/2019annualmeeting/) conference. 

We used a [Microsoft HoloLens](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens) as the hardware for the display. (The United States Army recently agreed to a $480 million [contract](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidhambling/2020/05/22/battlefield-augmented-reality-gets-real/#44d261917d8e) with Microsoft specifically for the HoloLens, a “mixed reality” headset). I was personally responsible for enabling the communication between the HoloLens and the Link 16 radio network. To achieve two-way communication, I exposed URL routes on a web server that was connected to the Link 16 network, allowing the encrypted Link 16 messages to be acquired through an HTTP GET request. I built a REST API using the [CherryPy](https://cherrypy.org/) Python library; the REST API issued the web requests to the web server. 

Additionally, I developed the global runtime manager in C# to handle the distribution of the Link 16 messages that were acquired by the REST API. The information was parsed and then distributed into the display’s “assets,” which included a map, compass and radar. Using the Link 16 radio data, I created an interactive and dynamic map, allowing soldiers to view friendly and hostile units in their area.

## [General Assembly: Data Science Course](https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science/new-york-city)
**Student**  
*June 2017 - August 2017*  
In the summer of 2017, I took [General Assembly's](https://generalassemb.ly/) [data science course](https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science/new-york-city), taught in New York City. During the course, we learned how to build machine learning algorithms – including decision trees, random forest regression and classification models, K-nearest neighbors, and logistic regression. We used Python's [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) libraries for collecting and cleaning the data, and we used the [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) library for implementing the models.

As part of the final project for the course, I built a random forest regression model in Python to predict the final sale prices of Iowa houses with over 90% accuracy. I then presented the model’s results to General Assembly faculty and students. The project is available on [Github](https://github.com/nico-espinosadice/house-price-prediction) and [Housing_Prices_Analysis.pdf](/img/Housing_Prices_Analysis.pdf).
