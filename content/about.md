Hello! I am a rising junior studying mathematics and computer science at Harvey Mudd College. My interests center around theoretical machine learning, as well as applications of machine learning towards fields including robotics and autonomous vehicles, astronomy and space exploration, medical imaging, and finance and trading.

This summer (2020), I will be a researcher in the [AMISTAD Lab](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~montanez/amistad.html) under [Professor George D. Montañez](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~montanez/). Our team is currently working on developing a mathematical framework of abductive reasoning for use in machine learning applications.

A list of the mathematics and computer science courses I have taken is available [here](/img/EspinosaDice_Coursework.pdf).

Listed below are some of the clubs and organizations I have been a part of. Check out the [Miscellaneous](/miscellaneous) page for other information.
